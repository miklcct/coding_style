            <h1>Constant</h1>
            <h2>Rule</h2>
            <p><strong>Constant names MUST be in <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code>.</strong></p>
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                All constants must be in <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code>. Constants refer to compile-time constants,
                not immutable variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                This rule applies to <code>enum</code> members as well because they are effectively constant.
            </p>
            <h2>Language-specific notes</h2>
            <h3>C / C++</h3>
            <p>
                This rule does not apply in C / C++ because <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code> is reserved for macros.
                Use the rule for variables to name constants in C / C++.
            </p>
            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>
                Although <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code> and <code>NULL</code> are predefined constants,
                <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code> are also reserved words which are case-insensitive.
                They are resolved at compiled time rather than runtime like magic constants.
                Therefore, they MUST be specified using lower case as <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magic constants, which are resolved at compiled time rather than runtime, are case insensitive.
                They are actually not constants which cannot be accessed via <code>defined()</code> and
                do not appear in <code>get_defined_constants()</code>.
                These MUST be specified using the case
                <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.magic.php">listed in the manual</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Haskell</h3>
            <p>
                This rule does not apply in Haskell because it is purely functional and does not distinguish between
                constants and variables.
