            <h1>Natural language</h1>
            <h2>Rule</h2>
            <p><strong>All names in a single project MUST be in a single language which is used by the target audience. For global projects, English must be used.</strong></p>
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                A project must be written in a single natural language. Mixing different natural languages in names
                is not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the project is not limited to specific regions, English must be used.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                A project developed solely for use in Hong Kong must be in either traditional Chinese or English.
                Although the interface should support both languages, the names in the code must be in either one but not both.
            </p>
            <p>
                A project developed for use only in the CIS must be in Russian, although the interface should also support
                other languages used in CIS, such as Kazakh, Azerbaijani, Kyrkyz, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                A project developed for use only in Singapore must be in English, although the interface should support
                all four languages in Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
                A project without regional limit must be in English, with the interface supporting as many languages as possible.
