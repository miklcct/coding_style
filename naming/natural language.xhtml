            <h1>Natural language</h1>
            <h2>Rule</h2>
            <p><strong>All names in a single project MUST be in a single language which is used by the target audience.</strong></p>
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                A project must be written in a single natural language. Mixing different natural languages in names
                is not allowed.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
                A project developed solely for use in Hong Kong must be in either traditional Chinese or English.
                Although the interface should support both languages, the names in the code must be in either one but not both.
